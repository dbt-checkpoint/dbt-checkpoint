:warning: Since v1.1.0, we've implemented a file discovery logic that "fills in" the missing files so that if the yml file is changed we find the corresponding sql file, to make sure we do the proper check.
With this implementation, certain Hooks now can receive `"--exclude", "pattern"` in it's args, which overrides the `exclude:pattern` YML configuration of pre-commit

Instead of doing this

```
- id: check-model-has-tests
  description: "Ensures that the model has a number of tests"
  args: ["--test-cnt", "1", "--"]
  exclude: |
    (?x)(
      models/demo
    )
```

Hooks that use `--exclude` in their args, should receive it this way:

```
- id: check-model-has-tests
  description: "Ensures that the model has a number of tests"
  args: ["--test-cnt", "1", "--exclude", "models/demo", "--"]
```

:exclamation:**If you have an idea for a new hook or you found a bug, [let us know](https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint/issues/new)**:exclamation:

## Available Hooks

### `check-column-desc-are-same`

Check the models have the same descriptions for the same column names.

#### Arguments

`--ignore`: columns for which do not check whether have a different description.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-column-desc-are-same
```

#### When to use it

E.g. in two of your models, you have `customer_id` with the description `This is cutomer_id`, but there is one model where column `customer_id` has a description `Something else`. This hook finds discrepancies between column descriptions.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|   :x: Not needed since it also validates properties files   |                       :x: Not needed                       |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml` and `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- Modified `yml` files are scanned for a model.
- If any column in the found model has different descriptions than others, the hook fails.
- The description must be in either the yml file **or** the manifest.

---

### `check-column-name-contract`

Check that column name abides to a contract, as described in [this blog post](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/column-name-contracts/) by Emily Riederer. A contract consists of a regex pattern and a series of data types.

#### Arguments

`--pattern`: Regex pattern to match column names.
`--dtypes`: Data types.
`--exclude`: Regex pattern to exclude files.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-column-name-contract
   args: [--pattern, "(is|has|do)_.*", --dtypes, boolean text timestamp, "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You want to make sure your columns follow a contract, e.g. all your boolean columns start with the prefixes `is_`, `has_` or `do_`.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|                       :x: Not needed                        |                   :white_check_mark: Yes                   |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The catalog is scanned for a model.
- If any column in the found model matches the regex pattern and it's data type does not match the contract's data type, the hook fails.
- If any column in the found model matches the contract's data type and does not match the regex pattern, the hook fails.

### `check-model-columns-have-desc`

Ensures that the model has columns with descriptions in the properties file (usually `schema.yml`).

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-columns-have-desc
```

#### When to use it

You want to make sure that all specified columns in the properties files (usually `schema.yml`) have some description. **This hook does not validate if all database columns are also present in a properties file.**

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|   :x: Not needed since it also validates properties files   |                       :x: Not needed                       |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml` and `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- Modified `yml` files are scanned for a model.
- If any column in the found model does not contain a description, the hook fails.
- The description must be in either the yml file **or** the manifest.

#### Known limitations

If you `run` your model and then you delete column description from a properties file, the hook success since the description is still present in `manifest.json`.

---

### `check-model-has-all-columns`

Ensures that all columns in the database are also specified in the properties file. (usually `schema.yml`).

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**<br/>
`--catalog`: location of `catalog.json` file. Usually `target/catalog.json`. dbt uses this file to render information like column types and table statistics into the docs site. In dbt-checkpoint is used for column operations. **Default: `target/catalog.json`**<br/>
`--exclude`: Regex pattern to exclude files.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-has-all-columns
```

#### When to use it

You want to make sure that you have all the database columns listed in the properties file, or that your properties file no longer contains deleted columns.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|                   :white_check_mark: Yes                    |                   :white_check_mark: Yes                   |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- The catalog is scanned for a model.
- If there is any discrepancy between manifest and catalog models, the hook fails.

#### Known limitations

If you did not update the catalog and manifest results can be wrong.

### `check-model-has-contract`

Checks that model's yaml has:

    config:
      contract:
        enforced: true

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**<br/>
`--exclude`: Regex pattern to exclude files.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-has-contract
```

#### When to use it

When you want to force developers to define model contracts.

#### How it works

It checks the generated manifest for the contract configuration

---

### `check-model-has-constraints`

Checks that model's yaml has specific constraints defined, eg:

```
  - name: products
    config:
      contract:
        enforced: true
    constraints:
      - type: foreign_key
        columns:
          - "product_id"
```

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**<br/>
`--constraints`: JSON string escaped by single quotes
`--exclude`: Regex pattern to exclude files.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/xasm83/dbt-checkpoint
  rev: v1.0.0
  hooks:
  - id: check-model-has-contract
  - id: check-model-has-constraints
    args: ["--constraints", '[{"type": "primary_key", "columns": ["product_id"]}]', "--"]
```

#### When to use it

When you want to force developers to define model constraints.

#### How it works

It checks the generated manifest for the required constraint. Only models with materialization "incremental" or "table" suport constraints. Enforced model contract is required as well. It checks only the keys defined in the '--constraints' parmeter, ie the actual constraint could have more parameters configured in dbt.

---

### `check-model-has-description`

| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|   :x: Not needed since it also validates properties files   |                       :x: Not needed                       |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml` and `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- Modified `yml` files are scanned for a model.
- If any model (from a manifest or `yml` files) does not have a description, the hook fails.
- The model description must be in either the yml file **or** the manifest.

#### Known limitations

If you `run` your model and then you delete the description from a properties file, the hook success since the description is still present in `manifest.json`.

---

### `check-model-has-meta-keys`

Ensures that the model has a list of valid meta keys. (usually `schema.yml`).

By default, it does not allow the model to have any other meta keys other than the ones required. An optional argument can be used to allow for extra keys.

|   :x: Not needed since it also validates properties files   |                       :x: Not needed                       |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml` and `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- Modified `yml` files are scanned for a model.
- If any model (from a manifest or `yml` files) does not have specified labels keys, the hook fails.
- The labels keys must be in either the yml file **or** the manifest.

#### Known limitations

If you `run` your model and then you delete labels keys from a properties file, the hook success since the labels keys is still present in `manifest.json`.

### `check-model-has-properties-file`

Ensures that the model has a properties file (schema file).

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**<br/>

#### Example

```
repos:

 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-has-properties-file
```

#### When to use it

You want to make sure that every model has a properties file.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- If any model does not have `patch_path`, the hook fails.

#### Known limitations

You need to create a schema file and then rerun your model (`dbt run` or `dbt compile`), otherwise, this hook will fail.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-script-ref-and-source
```

#### When to use it

Make sure you have only valid ref and sources in your script and you do not want to wait for `dbt run` to find them. This hook also finds all missing ref and sources, not find first missing only.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |

 hooks:
 - id: check-script-semicolon
```

#### When to use it

Make sure you did not provide a semicolon at the end of the file.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- It parses `SQL` and finds all sources and refs. If those objects do not exist in `manifest.json`, the hook fails.

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- `SQL` is parsed and if it contains direct tables (not ref() or source()), the hook fails.

---

### `check-source-columns-have-desc`

Ensures that the source has columns with descriptions in the properties file (usually `schema.yml`).

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-source-columns-have-desc
```

#### When to use it

You want to make sure that all specified columns in the properties files (usually `schema.yml`) have some description. **This hook does not validate if all database columns are also present in a properties file.**

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml`.
- All sources from yml file are parsed.
- If any column in the source does not contain a description, the hook fails.

---

### `check-source-has-all-columns`

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**<br/>
`--catalog`: location of `catalog.json` file. Usually `target/catalog.json`. dbt uses this file to render information like column types and table statistics into the docs site. In dbt-checkpoint is used for column operations. **Default: `target/catalog.json`**

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-source-has-all-columns
```

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml`.
- All sources from yml file are parsed.
- The catalog is scanned for a model.
- If there is any discrepancy between found yml sources and catalog sources, the hook fails.

#### Known limitations

If you did not update the catalog and manifest results can be wrong.

 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: generate-missing-sources
   args: ["--schema-file", "models/schema.yml", "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You are too lazy to define schemas manually :D.

#### Requirements

|        Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>        | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |

- If not, a new source is created in specified `schema-file` and the hook fails.

#### Known limitations

Source "envelope" has to exist in specified `schema-file`, something like this:

```
version: 2
sources:
- name: <source_name>
```

Otherwise, it is not possible to automatically generate a new source table.

Unfortunately, this hook breaks your formatting.

### `unify-column-description`

Unify column descriptions across all models.

#### Arguments

`--ignore`: Columns for which do not check whether have a different description.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: unify-column-description
   args: ["--ignore", "foo", "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You want the descriptions of the same columns to be the same. E.g. in two of your models, you have `customer_id` with the description `This is cutomer_id`, but there is one model where column `customer_id` has a description `Something else`. This hook finds discrepancies between column descriptions and replaces them. So as the results all columns going to have the description `This is customer_id`

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|   :x: Not needed since this hook is using only yaml files   |                       :x: Not needed                       |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `YAML` files.
- From those files columns are parsed and compared.
- If one column name has more than one (not empty) description, the description with the most occurrences is taken and the hook fails.
- If it is not possible to decide which description is dominant, no changes are made.

#### Known limitations

If it is not possible to decide which description is dominant, no changes are made.

### `replace-script-table-names`

Replace table names with `source` or `ref` macros in the script.

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: replace-script-table-names
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You are running and debugging your `SQL` in the editor. This editor does not know `source` or `ref` macros. So every time you copy the script from the editor into `dbt` project you need to rewrite all table names to `source` or `ref`. That's boring and error-prone. If you run this hook it will replace all table names with macros instead of you.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|                   :white_check_mark: Yes                    |                       :x: Not needed                       |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- SQL is parsed and table names are found.
- Firstly it tries to find table name in models - `ref`.
- Then it tries to find a table in sources - `source`.
- If nothing is found it creates unknown `source` as `source('<schema_name>', '<table_name>')`
- If the script contains only `ref` and `source` macros, the hook success.

---

### `generate-model-properties-file`

Generate model properties file if does not exist.

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**.<br/>
`--catalog`: location of `catalog.json` file. Usually `target/catalog.json`. dbt uses this file to render information like column types and table statistics into the docs site. In dbt-checkpoint is used for column operations. **Default: `target/catalog.json`**<br/>
`--properties-file`: Location of file where new model properties should be generated. Suffix has to be `yml` or `yaml`. It can also include {database}, {schema}, {name} and {alias} variables. E.g. /models/{schema}/{name}.yml for model `foo.bar` will create properties file in /models/foo/bar.yml. If path already exists, properties are appended.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: generate-model-properties-file
   args: ["--properties-file", "/models/{schema}/{name}.yml", "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You are running and debugging your `SQL` in the editor. This editor does not know `source` or `ref` macros. So every time you copy the script from the editor into `dbt` project you need to rewrite all table names to `source` or `ref`. That's boring and error-prone. If you run this hook it will replace all table names with macros instead of you.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|                   :white_check_mark: Yes                    |                          :x: Yes                           |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- The catalog is scanned for a model.
- If the model does not have `patch_path` in the manifest, the new schema is written to the specified path. The hook fails.

#### Known limitations

Unfortunately, this hook breaks your formatting in the written file.

---

### `remove-script-semicolon`

Remove the semicolon at the end of the script.

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: remove-script-semicolon
```

#### When to use it

You are too lazy or forgetful to delete one character at the end of the script.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|                       :x: Not needed                        |                       :x: Not needed                       |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt parse` before run this hook (dbt >= 1.5).<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- If the file contains a semicolon at the end of the file, it is removed and the hook fails.

### `check-database-casing-consistency`

compare Manifest and Catalog to ensure DB and Schemas have the same casing.

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**<br/>
`--catalog`: location of `catalog.json` file. Usually `target/catalog.json`. dbt uses this file to render information like column types and table statistics into the docs site. In dbt-checkpoint is used for column operations. **Default: `target/catalog.json`**<br/>

#### Example

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.2.1
 hooks:
 - id: check-database-casing-consistency
```

#### When to use it

If you want to make sure your dbt project (Manifest) and database (Catalog) are db.schema consistent

#### How it works

It compares models and sources databases and schemas in `manifest vs catalog`. If a db/schema in one of them presents a different casing, the hook fails.
