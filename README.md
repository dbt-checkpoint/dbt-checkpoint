## Brough to you by your friends at Datacoves

The Datacoves platform helps enterprises overcome their data delivery challenges quickly using dbt and Airflow, implementing best practices from the start without the need for multiple vendors or costly consultants.

Hosted VS Code, dbt-core, SqlFluff, and Airflow, find out more at [Datacoves.com](https://datacoves.com/product).

<br>

## Goal

dbt-checkpoint provides [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure the quality of your [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com) projects.

`dbt` is awesome, but when the number of models, sources, and macros in a project grows, it becomes challenging to maintain the same level of quality across developers. Users forget to update columns in property (yml) files or add table and column descriptions. Without automation the reviewer workload increases and unintentional errors may be missed. dbt-checkpoint allows organizations to add automated validations improving your code review and release process.

## Telemetry

dbt-checkpoint has telemetry built into some of its hooks to help the maintainers from Datacoves understand which hooks are being used and which are not to prioritize future development of dbt-checkpoint. We do not track credentials nor details of your dbt execution such as model names. We also do not track any of the dbt hooks, such as for generating documentation. The one detail we do use related to dbt is [the anonymous user_id generated by dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/dbt-artifacts#common-metadata) to help us identify distinct projects.

By default this is turned on – you can opt out of event tracking at any time by adding the following to your `.dbt-checkpoint.yaml` file:

```
version: 1
disable-tracking: true
```

## Setting dbt project root

You can specify a dbt project root directory for all hooks. This is particularly useful when your dbt project is not located at the root of your repository but in a sub-directory of it.

In that situation, you previously had to specify a `--manifest` flag in each hook.

Now, you can avoid repeating yourself by adding the `dbt-project-dir` key to your `.dbt-checkpoint.yaml` config file:

```yaml
version: 1
dbt-project-dir: my_dbt_project
```

This way, we will automatically look for the required manifest/catalog inside your `my_dbt_project` project folder.

## General `exclude` and per-hook excluding

Since `dbt-checkpoint 1.1.0`, certain hooks implement an implicit logic that "discover" their sql/yml equivalent for checking.

For a complete background please refer to [#118](https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint/issues/118).

Since the root-level `exclude` statement is handled by pre-commit, when those hooks discover their related sql/yml files, this root exclusion is ommitted (dbt-checkpoint re-includes files that may have been excluded). To exclude files from being discovered by this logic, the `exclude` path/regex must be provided in each hook ([#119](https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint/pull/119))

:exclamation:**If you have a suggestion for a new hook or you find a bug, [let us know](https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint/issues/new)**:exclamation:

## Install

For detailed installation and usage, instructions see [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) site.

```
pip install pre-commit
```

## Setup

1. Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your project root folder.
2. Add [list of hooks](#list-of-dbt-checkpoint-hooks) you want to run befor every commit. E.g.:

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
  rev: v1.2.1
  hooks:
  - id: dbt-parse
  - id: dbt-docs-generate
    args: ["--cmd-flags", "++no-compile"]
  - id: check-script-semicolon
  - id: check-script-has-no-table-name
  - id: check-model-has-all-columns
    name: Check columns - core
    files: ^models/core
  - id: check-model-has-all-columns
    name: Check columns - mart
    files: ^models/mart
  - id: check-model-columns-have-desc
    files: ^models/mart
```

3. Optionally, run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts. With this, `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`! You can also manually run `pre-commit run` after you `stage` all files you want to run. Or `pre-commit run --all-files` to run the hooks against all of the files (not only `staged`).

## Run in CI/CD

`dbt-checkpoint` for the most of the hooks needs `manifest.json` (see requirements section in hook documentation), that is in the `target` folder. Since this target folder is usually in `.gitignore`, you need to generate it. For that you need to run the `dbt-parse` command.
To be able to parse dbt, you also need [profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) file with your credentials. **To provide passwords and secrets use Github Secrets** (see example).

Say you want to check that a model contains at least two tests, you would use this configuration:

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.2.1
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-has-tests
   args: ["--test-cnt", "2", "--"]
```

To be able to run this in Github CI you need to modified it to:

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.2.1
 hooks:
 - id: dbt-parse
 - id: check-model-has-tests
   args: ["--test-cnt", "2", "--"]
```

### Create profiles.yml

First step is to create [profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile). E.g.

```
# example profiles.yml file
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      threads: 8
      client_session_keep_alive: true
      account: "{{ env_var('ACCOUNT') }}"
      database: "{{ env_var('DATABASE') }}"
      schema: "{{ env_var('SCHEMA') }}"
      user: "{{ env_var('USER') }}"
      password: "{{ env_var('PASSWORD') }}"
      role: "{{ env_var('ROLE') }}"
      warehouse: "{{ env_var('WAREHOUSE') }}"
```

and store this file in project root `./profiles.yml`.

### Create new workflow

- inside your Github repository create folder `.github/workflows` (unless it already exists).
- create new file e.g. `pr.yml`
- specify your workflow e.g.:

```
name: dbt-checkpoint

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  dbt-checkpoint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      ACCOUNT: ${{ vars.ACCOUNT }}
      DATABASE: ${{ vars.DATABASE }}
      SCHEMA: ${{ vars.SCHEMA }}
      USER: ${{ vars.USER }}
      PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
      ROLE: ${{ vars.ROLE }}
      WAREHOUSE: ${{ vars.WAREHOUSE }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2

      - id: Get file changes
        uses: trilom/file-changes-action@v1.2.4
        with:
          output: " "

      - name: Run dbt checkpoint
        uses: dbt-checkpoint/action@v0.1
        with:
          extra_args: --files ${{ steps.get_file_changes.outputs.files}}
          dbt_version: 1.6.3
          dbt_adapter: dbt-snowflake
```
