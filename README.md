[Montreal Analytics](https://www.montrealanalytics.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=dbt-checkpoint) is a full-stack data consultancy servicing North America, and are both a dbt Preferred Consulting Partner and Platinum dbt Certification Award winner.

## Goal

dbt-checkpoint provides [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure the quality of your [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com) projects.

`dbt` is awesome, but when the number of models, sources, and macros in a project grows, it becomes challenging to maintain the same level of quality across developers.. Users forget to update columns in property(yml) files or add table and column add descriptions. Without automation the reviewer workload increases and unintentional errors may be missed. dbt-checkpoint allows organizations to add automated validations improving your code review and release process.

## Telemetry

dbt-checkpoint has telemetry built into some of its hooks to help the maintainers from Datacoves and Montreal Analytics understand which hooks are being used and which are not to prioritize future development of dbt-checkpoint. We do not track credentials nor details of your dbt execution such as model names. We also do not track any of the dbt hooks, such as for generating documentation. The one detail we do use related to dbt is the anonymous project_id generated by dbt to help us identify distinct projects.

By default this is turned on – you can opt out of event tracking at any time by adding the following to your `.dbt-checkpoint.yaml` file:

```
disable-tracking: true
```

:exclamation:**If you have a suggestion for a new hook or you find a bug, [let us know](https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint/issues/new)**:exclamation:

## Install

For detailed installation and usage, instructions see [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) site.

```
pip install pre-commit
```

## Setup

1. Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your project root folder.
2. Add [list of hooks](#list-of-dbt-checkpoint-hooks) you want to run befor every commit. E.g.:

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
  rev: v1.1.0
  hooks:
  - id: check-script-semicolon
  - id: check-script-has-no-table-name
  - id: dbt-test
  - id: dbt-docs-generate
  - id: check-model-has-all-columns
    name: Check columns - core
    files: ^models/core
  - id: check-model-has-all-columns
    name: Check columns - mart
    files: ^models/mart
  - id: check-model-columns-have-desc
    files: ^models/mart
```

3. Optionally, run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts. With this, `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`! You can also manually run `pre-commit run` after you `stage` all files you want to run. Or `pre-commit run --all-files` to run the hooks against all of the files (not only `staged`).

## Run as Github Action

Unfortunately, you cannot natively use `dbt-checkpoint` if you are using **dbt Cloud**. But you can run checks after you push changes into Github.

`dbt-checkpoint` for the most of the hooks needs `manifest.json` (see requirements section in hook documentation), that is in the `target` folder. Since this target folder is usually in `.gitignore`, you need to generate it. For that you need to run `dbt-compile` (or `dbt-run`) command.
To be able to compile dbt, you also need [profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) file with your credentials. **To provide passwords and secrets use Github Secrets** (see example).

Say you want to check that a model contains at least two tests, you would use this configuration:

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.1.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-has-tests
   args: ["--test-cnt", "2", "--"]
```

To be able to run this in Github actions you need to modified it to:

```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint
 rev: v1.1.0
 hooks:
 - id: dbt-compile
   args: ["--cmd-flags", "++profiles-dir", "."]
 - id: check-model-has-tests
   args: ["--test-cnt", "2", "--"]
```

### Create profiles.yml

First step is to create [profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile). E.g.

```
# example profiles.yml file
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: localhost
      user: alice
      password: "{{ env_var('DB_PASSWORD') }}"
      port: 5432
      dbname: jaffle_shop
      schema: dbt_alice
      threads: 4
```

and store this file in project root `./profiles.yml`.

### Create new workflow

- inside your Github repository create folder `.github/workflows` (unless it already exists).
- create new file e.g. `pr.yml`
- specify your workflow e.g.:

```
name: pre-commit

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  pre-commit:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
  - id: file_changes
    uses: trilom/file-changes-action@v1.2.4
    with:
      output: ' '
  - uses: dbt-checkpoint/dbt-checkpoint@v1.1.0
    env:
      DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SuperSecret }}
    with:
      args: run --files ${{ steps.file_changes.outputs.files}}
```
